## Project Details
In this project, I utilised my knowledge of Java and the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The design and structure were created by following UML diagrams, ensuring a coherent and maintainable codebase. Additionally, I employed JUnit testing to test and validate the game logic, ensuring reliability and correctness.
